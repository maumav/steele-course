VARIABLES 

    let year = 1998;

    let numHens = 5;
    let numRoosters = 1;

    ''' 
        let numHens = 5;
        undefined
        let numRoosters = 1
        undefined
        numHens

        12 
    '''

i++ (post-increment)
 
++i (pre-increment) 

const 
    can't change the value of constant variable 
        example: const luckyNum = 5
        luckyNum += 1  will throw error

BOOLEANS 
    true or false value

Start section 15: Javascript Strings
    Strings are textual information
    Strings are indexed, meaning it has a corresponding number for each character. 
    Includes space if there are more than one word in the string.
        Starting at 0.

    To access the indices, use variableName[] brackets
    example:
        let animal = "Lizard"
        animal[0]
        "L"

    Concatenate strings, is adding strings together.
    example:
        "hi" + " there"
        "hi there" 
    let firstName = "Damian"
    let lastName = " Wayne"
        firstName + lastName
        "Damina Wayne"

   METHODS
   ```
    message1 = "i love food"   
    message.toUpperCase()
    message1
    "I LOVE FOOD"
    ```

    ```
    let greeting = "     good night   "
    greeting.trim().toUpperCase()
    greeting
    "GOOD NIGHT"
    ```
    SLICE METHOD
    ```
    "haha that is so funny".slice(5)
    "that is so funny" #starting at index 0("), index 5 is space
    ```  
    REPLACE
    
    ```
    let greeting1 = "Good Morning"
    greeting1.replace('Good', 'Bad')
    "Bad Morning" 

    greeting1
    "Good Morning" #.replace does not change the original variable
    ```

    ```
    let word = "skateboard"

    let word2 = word.slice(5)
    
    let facialHair = word2.replace('o', 'e')

    ```

      TEMPLATE LITERAL
       Uses back tick.
        ` You bought ${qty} ${product}.    ` #this turns into a string automatically.

    NULL & UNDEFINED

        Null: "intentional absense of any value"
                must be assigned.
        Undefined: "Variables that do not have an assigned value are undefined."

        
Math.floor(Math,randon() * 3) + 1

SECTION: Making decision aka Boolean Logic

    Comparison Operators
    Conditionals: IF, ELSE-IF, AND
    True False values 
    Logical AND, OR, NOT

    COMPARISONS 
        double equal (equality)
            checks for equality of value, not equality of types.
            coerces both values to the same type and then compares them.
            can lead to unexpected results.

                1 == 1
                true

                1 == '1'
                true

                0 == false 
                true
        triple equal (strict equality)
            cares about type
            1 === '1'
            false

        1 != 2
        true

        1 != '2'
        true

        1 != '1'
        false

        1 !== '1'
        true

CONSOLE ALERT PROMPT

console.log

    let userInput = prompt("please enter a number)

    parseInt(userInput) #make the string into integer

CONDITIONALS - making decisions with code

    IF statement - only runs code if given condition is true.
    
 FALSE 
    0
    ""empty string
    null
    undefined
    NaN 

    EVERYTHING ELSE is TRUTHY

Logical Operators

    && 
        both sides must be true, for the entire thing to be true.
    || (pipe) (logical OR)
        if one side is true, entire thing is true.
    ! 
         expression returns true if expression is false

ARRAYS
    ordered collections of values.
    strings array
        let colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow'];
    number arrays 
        let numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    mixed arrays 
        arrays with boolean, numbers or strings in one array.

    PUSH
        add to end 
    POP
        remove from end
    SHIFT
        remove from start
    UNSHIFT
        add to start
