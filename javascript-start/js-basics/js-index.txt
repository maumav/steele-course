Start section 15: Javascript Strings
    Strings are textual information
    Strings are indexed, meaning it has a corresponding number for each character. 
    Includes space if there are more than one word in the string.
        Starting at 0.

    To access the indices, use variableName[] brackets
    example:
        let animal = "Lizard"
        animal[0]
        "L"

    Concatenate strings, is adding strings together.
    example:
        "hi" + " there"
        "hi there" 
    let firstName = "Damian"
    let lastName = " Wayne"
        firstName + lastName
        "Damina Wayne"

   METHODS
   ```
    message1 = "i love food"   
    message.toUpperCase()
    message1
    "I LOVE FOOD"
    ```

    ```
    let greeting = "     good night   "
    greeting.trim().toUpperCase()
    greeting
    "GOOD NIGHT"
    ```
    SLICE METHOD
    ```
    "haha that is so funny".slice(5)
    "that is so funny" #starting at index 0("), index 5 is space
    ```  
    REPLACE
    
    ```
    let greeting1 = "Good Morning"
    greeting1.replace('Good', 'Bad')
    "Bad Morning" 

    greeting1
    "Good Morning" #.replace does not change the original variable
    ```

    ```
    let word = "skateboard"

    let word2 = word.slice(5)
    
    let facialHair = word2.replace('o', 'e')

    ```

      TEMPLATE LITERAL
       Uses back tick.
        ` You bought ${qty} ${product}.    ` #this turns into a string automatically.

    NULL & UNDEFINED

        Null: "intentional absense of any value"
                must be assigned.
        Undefined: "Variables that do not have an assigned value are undefined."
